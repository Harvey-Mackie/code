Inspired by the Clean Coder Book


## Professionalism

- **Take Responsibility:** Focus on producing quality code without sacrificing standards to meet deadlines. This minimizes the risk of code breaking in production, affecting customers.
- **Do No Harm:** Adhere to the principle similar to a doctor's oath to prevent introducing bugs into the code. Aim for QA to find no bugs; learn from any that are found to prevent future occurrences.
- **Automate Tests:** Automating tests ensures you understand your code's functionality and can confidently make changes, aiming for 100% coverage.
- **Work Ethic:** Your career growth is your responsibility. Dedicate around 20 hours per week to learning something new and exciting to enhance your value as a professional.
- **Continuous Learning:** Just as doctors and lawyers must stay updated with their fields, so must developers to remain relevant and employable.
- **Know Your Domain:** Understanding the why behind your code is crucial. Challenge and understand the specifications you are implementing.
- **Humility:** True professionals are confidently aware of their skills, not falsely humble. They take calculated risks and pride in their work.

### **Saying No**

- **Firm Commitment:** Understand the difference between commitment and attempting. Professionals are expected to say no when necessary, providing clarity and not hiding behind uncertainty.
- **Handling Failure:** If a deadline is at risk, communicate this early to manage expectations and strategize on prioritization or collaboration.

### **Coding Practices**

- **Focused Coding:** Avoid coding when distracted. Errors are more likely when not fully present. Address personal issues to clear your mind before coding.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Use TDD to maintain high code coverage and safeguard against losing track of your work. This approach keeps the coding context clear, especially after interruptions.

### **Test-Driven Development**

- **TDD Laws:**
    - Write a failing test before any production code.
    - Only write enough of a test to fail.
    - Only write enough production code to pass the failing test.
- **Certainty:** High code coverage provides assurance that the code functions as expected, reducing the fear associated with making changes.

### **Practicing**

- **Kata:** Practice coding challenges regularly to sharpen your coding reflexes, much like an athlete's routine.
- **Ethics of Practice:** Practice in your own time. Sharpening your skills should not be an employer's responsibility.

### **Acceptance Testing**

- **Automate Tests:** Automation reduces the cost and dependency on manual testing.
- **Tests as Documentation:** Well-written tests describe the structure and behavior of the application and can serve as effective documentation.
- **Testing Interfaces:** Prefer testing business rules through stable interfaces like APIs rather than through frequently changing GUIs.

### **Time Management**

- **Routine:** Organize your day to maximize productivity, such as starting early and segmenting your day into focused intervals.
- **Recharge:** Balance intense focus periods with breaks to maintain long-term productivity.

### **Estimation**

- **PERT:** Use Optimistic, Normal, and Pessimistic estimates to cover all possible scenarios.
- **Planning Poker:** Utilize anonymous collective estimating to prevent bias and align team expectations.

### **Pressure**

- **Crisis Discipline:** Establish and consistently follow best practices to prevent crises. Adhere to these disciplines especially under pressure.

### **Mentoring**

- **Levels of Software Engineers:** Recognize the stages of a software engineering career from apprentices to masters, each with specific roles and responsibilities.

### **Craftsmanship**

- **Professionalism and Skill:** Emphasize quality, speed without haste, and the ability to make accurate estimates and commitments. A craftsman embodies professionalism and continually strives for excellence.

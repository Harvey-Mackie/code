# **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

- **What is TDD?**
    - Development methodology where tests are written before the code.
- **Benefits of TDD**
    - Promotes more focused and granular development.
    - Increases code coverage and documentation.
    - Facilitates easier integration of new functionalities.
- **TDD Process**
    - Write a failing test, implement code to pass the test, refactor, and repeat.

# Types of Testing

- **Unit Tests**
    - Tests that cover a single "unit of code", typically a method or function.
    - Focus on testing the behaviour rather than implementation details like getters/setters.
- **Integration Testing**
    - Tests how different modules or services work together.

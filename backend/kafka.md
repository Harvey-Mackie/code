## **Key Concepts**

- **Kafka Broker**: Acts as the central point for message distribution, hosting various topics within which the data is organized.
- **Topics and Partitions**:
    - Topics are the main categories under which messages are published.
    - Each topic contains partitions that segment the data, enabling parallel data processing and enhanced scalability.
- **Consumer Groups**:
    - Comprise all the consumers that subscribe to a topic.
    - Manage the distribution of partitions among consumers, ensuring that each partition is processed by only one consumer in the group at any time.
- **Rebalancing**:
    - Occurs when a consumer joins or leaves a group. The group automatically adjusts the partition assignment among its remaining consumers to ensure all partitions continue to be covered efficiently.
- **Offsets**:
    - Kafka tracks the offset, which is the position of the consumer in the partition. This mechanism allows consumers to resume data processing from where they left off without duplication.
    - Unlike traditional MQ systems that delete messages post-consumption, Kafka retains all messages in the queue. This allows messages to be read repeatedly and prevents loss, making it highly reliable for critical data processing tasks.

## **Usage**

Kafka is ideal for scenarios requiring high throughput, fault tolerance, and redundancy. It supports multiple consumers and maintains message order within each partition, making it a robust choice for large-scale, real-time applications.
